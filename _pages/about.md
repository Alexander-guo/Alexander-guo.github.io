<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

Welcome to my personal website! 

 I am Jinyuan, a skilled **robotics software engineer** and **full-stack developer** with a proactive can-do spirit, adept at swiftly adapting to new challenges. With expertise in **computer vision, machine learning and full-stack development**, I bring a comprehensive skill set to consistently deliver high-quality end-to-end software solutions. 
 
 I completed my master degree specializing in Robotics from [Penn](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/). My primary focus is in **computer vision, motion analysis, sensor fusion and deep learning** techniques. At Penn, I researched on event-based neuromorphic perception algorithms for robotic motion analysis at [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) [Kostas Group](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). Before that, I acquired my bachelor degree in Mechatronics from Tongji University. 


#### Interests

I am deeply passionate about the intersection of cutting-edge technologies that shape the future. My interests lie at the forefront of innovation, particularly in the realms of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. Exploring the limitless possibilities of intelligent machines and leveraging the power of visual perception and advanced learning techniques are the driving forces behind my curiosity.

Beyond being a developer, I am also keen on anything creative and cultural. I take [documentary street photographs](https://www.jinyuanguo.com/). Whether I am exploring breathtaking landscapes, documenting candid moments, or capturing the vibrant essence of life through my lens, as my nice way to express creativity and share unique perspectives with others, photography bridges the gap between the analytical and the artistic.
