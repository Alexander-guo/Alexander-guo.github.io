Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a dedicated student with a passion for robotics, computer vision, and deep learning. I acquired my MSE. in Mechanical Engineering with concentration in Mechatronics and Robotics from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) in 2023. At Penn, I worked on [Event-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) neuromorphic perception algorithms for robotic motion analysis advisied by [Prof. Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/) at [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I graduated from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/) with a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering in 2020, where I was supervised by [Prof. Qirong Tang](http://robotics-tongji.org/members/qtang) for my dissertation on trajectory tracking for Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System.

### Interests

I am keen on anything about robotics, especically in 3D computer vision and deep learning. I am particularly excited about the potential for robotics and computer vision to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, transportation, and entertainment, making a positive impact on people's lives.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid photographer. It has taught me to appreciate the subtleties of light, composition, and storytelling. Whether I am exploring breathtaking landscapes, documenting candid moments, or capturing the essence of a subject in a portrait, photography allows me to express my creativity and share unique perspectives with others.
